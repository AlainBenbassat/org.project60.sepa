These folders represent the file formats for collection submissions.

In order to make a new file format available to CiviSEPA, add it to 'resources/formats_option_group.json' and disable/enable the extension.

If you want to add your own format, put them in an extra extension in the same folder structure, and add to the 'sepa_file_format' option group manually.
